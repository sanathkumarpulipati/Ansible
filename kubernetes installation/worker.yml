# To use this Ansible setup:

# First, modify the IP addresses in the inventory.yml to match your actual server addresses.
# Ensure you have SSH access to both servers and that the SSH key specified in the inventory is correct.
# Install Ansible on your control machine if you haven't already:
# bashsudo apt update
# sudo apt install ansible

# Create all the necessary files in a directory:
# bashmkdir k8s-ansible
# cd k8s-ansible
# # Create all the files shown above

# Execute the playbook:
# bashansible-playbook -i inventory.yml k8s-cluster.yml


# This setup:

# Uses Kubernetes 1.29
# Configures containerd as the container runtime
# Deploys Flannel as the CNI network plugin
# Automatically joins the worker node to the master

# After running the playbook, you can verify your cluster by SSH'ing into the master node and running:
# bashkubectl get nodes
# Both nodes should show up in the list and transition to "Ready" status within a few minutes.
